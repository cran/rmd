\title{rmd: Easily Install and Load the R Markdown Family}

The 'rmd' package manages multiple R markdown packages. These R markdown packages include currently 'rmarkdown', 'knitr', 'bookdown', 'bookdownplus', 'blogdown', 'rticles',  'tinytex', 'xaringan', 'citr',  and 'mindr'. They can be installed and loaded in a single step with the 'rmd' package. The conflicts between these packages are evaluated as well.
